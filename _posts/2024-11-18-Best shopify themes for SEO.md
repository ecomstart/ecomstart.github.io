# Can I Keep My Domain if I Cancel Shopify?

One of the most frequently asked questions by Shopify users is whether they can retain their domain after canceling their Shopify subscription. Your domain is a key part of your brand’s online identity, so it’s essential to understand the options and steps involved. In this blog, we’ll explore what happens to your domain when you decide to leave Shopify and how you can maintain control over it.

## Understanding Domain Ownership on Shopify

When you purchase a domain through Shopify, you technically own that domain. Shopify acts as a domain registrar, facilitating your purchase and renewal. However, the rights to the domain belong to you as long as it remains active and renewed. This means that even if you cancel your Shopify subscription, your domain can still be managed and transferred elsewhere.

## Steps to Keep Your Domain After Canceling Shopify

### 1. Transfer Your Domain
Shopify allows you to transfer your domain to another registrar, such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Shopify admin panel.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Domains**.
3. Unlock your domain and retrieve the transfer code (also known as the EPP code).
4. Use this code to initiate a transfer with your new registrar.

### 2. Point Your Domain Elsewhere
If you’ve purchased your domain through Shopify but don’t want to transfer it, you can redirect it to another platform by adjusting the DNS settings. Update the **A record** and **CNAME** to point to your new hosting provider.

### 3. Renew Your Domain
Ensure your domain is renewed before leaving Shopify to avoid losing it. You can renew directly through Shopify or your new registrar if the transfer is complete.

## What Happens if You Don’t Take Action?

If you don’t transfer or point your domain before canceling your Shopify account, it may remain accessible for a limited time through Shopify’s domain management system. However, neglecting to renew the domain could result in its expiration, making it available for others to purchase.

## Key Considerations Before Canceling

- **Email Hosting**: If your domain includes email hosting tied to Shopify, you’ll need to migrate your email services to a new provider. Failing to do so may result in losing important communication channels.
- **Subdomains**: Check if any subdomains are being used and ensure they’re updated or migrated as needed.
- **SEO Implications**: Retaining your domain ensures that your website’s SEO value and online presence remain intact, even after switching platforms.

## Why Keeping Your Domain is Important

Your domain is more than just an address; it’s a representation of your brand and an essential asset for maintaining customer trust. By retaining control over it, you ensure continuity and avoid disruptions to your online identity.
